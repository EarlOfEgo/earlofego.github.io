##About
---
First, this is not a blog, or should be one.<br>
This is a place where I collect my thoughts and the things I've done.
It should help me to remember some settings and stuff, which I made only one or two times.
Maybe someone else can use the information given on this no-blog.
If so I'm glad that it helps somebody, if not I can also live with it.<br>
Everything I show here worked for ME and MY system, which means I provide no guaranty about it.
##Who Am I
---
Hacking this into my terminal I got:
{% highlight bash %}
$whoami
stephan
{% endhighlight %}
So not much output here.<br>
If you are really smart you recognized that my system tells us that my name is Stephan instead of EarlOfEgo.<br>
The reason for this is quite simple, my system is trying to trick us.
##My System
---
Archey gives me this:

    User: stephan
    Hostname: x300
    Distro: Arch Linux
    Kernel: 3.11.4-1-ARCH
    Uptime: 2:58
    Window Manager: i3
    Desktop Environment: 
    Shell: /usr/bin/fish
    Terminal: rxvt-unicode-256color
    Packages: 855
    CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU L7100 @ 1.20GHz
    RAM: 596 MB / 1978 MB 
    Disk: 41G / 58G
Looking at this you will notice that I use [fish](http://fishshell.com/) as shell.<br>
For this reason I will never use the 'export' command and never write into the .bashrc.

##Additional Information
---
This site was created by using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), the [jekyll-bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap) and a modified theme called [tom](http://themes.jekyllbootstrap.com/preview/tom/). And it is hosted by the wonderful github.
<br>
I have no idea about web programming, so I did't change much on the default settings.<br>
